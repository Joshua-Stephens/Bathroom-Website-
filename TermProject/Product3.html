            Do plan on making an investment: Baths in general cost more per square foot to renovate than other parts of the house, partly because running plumbing is pricey and making wet areas watertight, well lit, and ventilated requires a host of skills. “As with any renovation, an experienced GC can help you decide where to spend and where to save,” says architect Jerry Allan of Afton, MN, who adds that clients often come to him with photos found online and little idea of what is needed to achieve the look they are after.

                    Sheets of glass create an airy feel. Hinges can be adjusted to allow doors to swing into the shower, so wet doors can drip inside the enclosure. Shown: Dreamline Unidoor Frameless Hinged Shower Door in Oil-Rubbed Bronze, $719; Kitchen & Bath Authority

                    Where space is tight, a splash guard—a panel that’s hinged or stationary—can suffice. Works best for bathers who are careful where they aim the spray. Shown: Vigo Zenith Frameless Fixed Shower Door in Black, $440; The Home Depot

        <p>
            <strong>Pro:</strong> At very affordable prices, fiberglass tubs are good for those on a tight budget. Due to the lightweight nature of the material used, they are also easy to maneuver around a house and install, plus, any damages can be easily be repaired

        <p>
            <strong>Pro:</strong> Porcelain bathtubsmaintain a very nice sheen and luster, and their surfaces are very smooth as well, maintaining an old antique aesthetic. The coating in the tubs are naturally resistant to scratching and cleaning is easy to maintain as a mild detergent or baking soda with warm water will usually knock out any tough stains in a porcelain bathtub.

        <p>
            <strong>Pro:</strong> Like with most resin, color does not fade with repeated water use, the material is non-porous meaning it does not absorb water and retains water heat very well. It has an incredibly long lifespan, lasting for quite some time without the need of constant repair and when it needs to be discarded, stone resin is 100% recyclable. Stone resin is also viewed as a more luxurious bathtub material, not to mention the material itself is quite durable and able to withstand a heavy amount of punishment. Additionally, cleaning is simple and easy. Most stains and mildew will wash away with simple warm water while lightly abrasive substances such as Comet or Ajax can be used for more stubborn residues. Stone Resin is the best bathtub material overall for the price and quality.
