        <header><h2>Porcelain & Ceramic Tiles</h2></header>
        <img src="tilepage.jpg" alt="tiles photo">

        <p>
            There’s a reason why porcelain and ceramic are classic bathroom flooring choices. Not only are they waterproof, but they’re also relatively inexpensive and can mimic the look of pricier materials such as natural stone or wood. (And while the two materials are similar in composition, porcelain is different from ceramic in that it’s made from more refined clay and fired at a higher temperature, making it more durable and less porous.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In terms of styles, porcelain and ceramic are offered in an endless array of sizes, shapes, textures, and colors, so your design choices are practically limitless.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Porcelain and ceramic are cold to the touch, but they’re also very receptive to radiant heating laid underneath. In fact, if your desire is to have a bathroom with heated flooring, porcelain and ceramic are the most popular options.
        </p>

        <p>
            A con to these materials? They can be slippery. Choose a tile with a textured surface or smaller tiles that require more grout, which provides better traction. 
        </p>

        <header><h2>Natural Stone Tiles</h2></header>
        <img src="tilepage1.jpg" alt="tiles photo">

        <p>
            Durable and attractive natural stone always exudes an air of luxury, but it’s pricey and not completely waterproof. Softer materials like travertine and limestone need to be resealed every couple of years, while harder stones like marble and granite can last up to five years before having to reseal them. If you can afford natural stone and don’t mind refinishing the floor once in a while, it’s certainly one way to raise the resale value of your home. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Like porcelain and ceramic, stone feels cold to the touch, but this problem can be eliminated with underfloor heating. Also like ceramic and porcelain, it is a very slippery material; consider choosing a stone that’s been honed or tumbled instead of polished, or something that’s been textured with sandblasting. There are also naturally textured stones such as slate. 
        </p>
        
        <header><h2>Vinyl</h2></header>
        <img src="tilepage2.png" alt="tiles photo">

        <p>
            For the past decade, vinyl has surged in popularity as a bathroom flooring material due to its water-resistance, reasonable pricing, and ease of installation. This has resulted in a plethora of styles and designs flooding the market. The material comes as sheets, planks, or tiles, with sheets being the best option for bathrooms because the installation is virtually seamless, making it waterproof.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two types of vinyl composition: wood plastic composite (WPC) and stone plastic composite (SPC). Both are made with a waterproof core, but WPC is preferred for being thicker, more flexible, and more resilient. 
        </p>

        <p>
            While vinyl is extremely durable, it can develop bumps, gaps, or curls after a period of time. Vinyl can also be hard to fix if it is pierced by a sharp object. And because the material is so well-priced, it won’t do as much for your home’s resale value as more expensive materials might.
        </p>

        <p>
            Laminate is often confused with vinyl, but the former has a wood-chip base that makes it an inferior bathroom flooring material. If the wood comes in contact with water, it will absorb it and bubble up, and eventually, the flooring will need to be replaced.
